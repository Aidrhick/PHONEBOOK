# Phonebook System - First Year C++ Project

This is a simple Phonebook system written in C++ as a first-year programming project, developed together with my groupmates.

## Features

- Add new contacts (up to 15)
- Search for contacts by name
- Update or delete contacts (except emergency contacts)
- Display all contacts
- Input validation for names and numbers

## How to Run

1. Compile the code with a C++ compiler (e.g., `g++ phonebook.cpp -o phonebook`).
2. Run the executable in a Windows environment (uses `conio.h`, `system("cls")`).
